# Arrival Time Esstimation

* ## Arrival Time Esstimation of cars using 4parametes 
   + Distance
   + Speed
   + Weather conditions
   + Traffic

* ### Formula:
   + (Distance / Speed) * w0 + Traffic * w1 + Weather conditions * w2 + b
* ### This project:
   + The main goal of this mini project is to develop a system that can learn parameters and minimum the loss in order to predict arrival time with least error.
